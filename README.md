# freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

This is the website where I learn first programming language which is JavaScript. I only use prompt to ask user what project they want to test and ofcourse the output will be in console through inspecting the browser.

## Here are the projects you can test through this link (still empty):

- Palindrome Checker
- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register
